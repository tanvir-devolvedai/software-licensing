#### Note: Initially you can do step 1 only and another step later if you require more time to implement it.


## Step 1. Cryptographically Signed Licenses with Asymmetric Encryption
   - Implementation:
     - Use RSA or ECC to generate a key pair (private key on your server, public key embedded in the software).
     - License files include user-specific data (user ID, expiration date, subscription tier) signed with the private key.
     - The software validates the signature using the public key and checks the expiration date locally.
   - Security: Tamper-proof licenses; modifications invalidate the signature.
   - Efficiency: Offline validation reduces server load, but periodic online checks ensure subscription status is current.

## Step 2. Hardware-Based Binding (Fingerprinting)
   - Implementation:
     - Generate a hardware fingerprint using unique identifiers (e.g., MAC address, TPM, disk serial number).
     - Store the fingerprint in the license and validate it during startup.
     - Allow limited hardware changes (e.g., 3 transfers) via a self-service portal.
   - Security: Prevents license sharing across devices.
   - Efficiency: Transparent to users unless hardware changes occur; integrate with activation for seamless transfers.

## Best Practices for Enhanced Security:
   - Code Protection: Obfuscate code and use anti-debugging tools to deter reverse engineering.
   - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Add an extra layer for user logins.
   - Fail-Safe Design: Ensure the software degrades gracefully (e.g., limited functionality) if validation fails, avoiding abrupt denials.
   - Audit Trails: Log license validations and user actions for anomaly detection.

### Example Workflow: In a nutshell (signed licenses + hardware binding + online checks)
- User purchases a subscription â†’ Server generates a license file signed with the private key, including hardware ID and expiry.
- Software validates the signature and hardware on startup, then checks the server periodically.
- For renewals, the server issues a new signed license; for cancellations, the API blocks access.
